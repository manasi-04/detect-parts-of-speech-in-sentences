# detect-parts-of-speech-in-sentences
This repo contains the code to detect percentage of sentences having nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverb.

To run this code locally start both front end and backend and if there is some error in the data retrived from the file then it could be because of splitting bacsed on '\n'. Locally I had to use '\r\n\r\n'. I have kept a log also tehre to debug the same if it fails.
To start with the project please install all dependencies in frontend and root folder.
